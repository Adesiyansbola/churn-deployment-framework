# churn-deployment-framework
A reproducible, simulator-driven reference implementation for customer churn prediction pipelines using web analytics and machine learning.

This repository accompanies a SoftwareX
manuscript and demonstrates how predictive models can be operationalized into
end-to-end decision-support systems.

## Overview
This project provides an end-to-end reference implementation for:
- Behavioral data ingestion and preprocessing
- Machine learning–based churn prediction
- Model explainability and evaluation
- Deployment-oriented system integration

The framework emphasizes **operational readiness**, **reproducibility**, and
**transparent experimentation** rather than algorithmic novelty.

## Key Features
- Modular machine learning pipeline
- Synthetic behavioral data generator for reproducibility
- Explainable model outputs
- Deployment-ready architecture
- Clear separation between data, models, and interface layers
