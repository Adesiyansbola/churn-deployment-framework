# Churn Deployment Framework

## Overview
A reproducible reference implementation for simulating customer churn,
training machine-learning models, and demonstrating deployment via
a decision-support dashboard.

## Key Features
- Synthetic churn data generator with configurable behavior rules
- Feature engineering pipeline for engagement signals
- ML training with XGBoost and baseline-ready structure
- Streamlit dashboard for risk scoring and inspection

## Installation
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Synthetic Data
Churn labels are generated via a probabilistic behavior-based model.
This simulator is fully specified and intended for reproducible experimentation.

## Intended Use
Research prototyping, ML education, pipeline validation, and deployment demonstrations.
Not intended as a production-ready enterprise system.
